I am a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and a member of the [Web Science and Digital Libraries (WS-DL) research group](https://oduwsdl.github.io/) at Old Dominion University. I joined CS department in Fall 2020. Before joining ODU, I was a full-time faculty at [Physics, Computer Science and Engineering Department (PCSE) at CNU]( https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/pcse/) (Christopher Newport University) for 2019-2020 academic year. And before that I was an adjunct instructional faculty at [Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech]( https://cs.vt.edu/) for two years (2017-2019) which I have taught several different courses.


I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Texas A&M University in 2016. I was a member of the [Center for the Study of the Digital Libraries (CSDL)](https://www.csdl.tamu.edu/) group. [Dr. Frank Shipman]( http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~shipman/) was my advisor.
My research interests are in Computer Human Interaction (HCI), Digital Data Preservation, Digital Libraries, Web Archive, Social Computing, Web Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Mining, and Information Retrieval.


I have mentored students at Virginia Tech, CNU and Texas A&M University in various undergraduate research programs including NSF REU. I always look forward to working with talented and self-motivated students who are interested in doing research with me.

Undergraduate (and graduate) students who would like to work with me, please feel free to drop me an email with your CV/resume.
