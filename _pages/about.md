I am a research assistant professor at Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center at Old Dominion University. 
Preceding my affiliation with VMASC, I served as a lecturer within the Department of Computer Science and was a member of the [Web Science and Digital Libraries (WS-DL) research group](https://oduwsdl.github.io/) at Old Dominion University from Fall 2020-2023. Previously, I was a full-time faculty at [Physics, Computer Science and Engineering Department (PCSE) at CNU]( https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/pcse/) (Christopher Newport University) for 2019-2020 academic year. And before that I was an adjunct instructional faculty at [Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech]( https://cs.vt.edu/) for two years (2017-2019) which I have taught several different courses. I have 10+ years of teaching experience. 


I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Texas A&M University in 2016 advised by [Frank Shipman]( http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~shipman/). I was a member of the [Center for the Study of the Digital Libraries (CSDL)](https://www.csdl.tamu.edu/) group.
My research interests are in social computing, web and data science, natural language processing, digital libraries, human-computer interaction, and applied machine learning. My current research focuses on identifying and countering deceptive information on online social platforms.


I have mentored students at ODU, Virginia Tech, CNU and Texas A&M University in various undergraduate research programs including NSF REU. I always look forward to working with talented and self-motivated students who are interested in doing research with me.

Undergraduate and graduate students who would like to work with me, please feel free to drop me an email with your CV/resume.
